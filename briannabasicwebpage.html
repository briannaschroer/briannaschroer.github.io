<h1>BRIANNA'S BASIC WEBPAGE</h1>
<h2>About me</h2>
<blockquote>
  "I have no idea what I am doing"
</blockquote>



<p>I'm from St. Louis, Missouri and will graduate from the University of Missouri in December. I knew designing was in my future as soon as I started bonding with my co-workers over a mutual hatred of comic sans, love of white space and caffeine dependency. When I'm not geeking out over fonts and color palettes, I enjoy working out, binge-watching The Office and eating cool food.</p>
<p>I am currently designing at <a href="http://pilotonline.com/">The Virginian-Pilot.</a></p>
<br>

<h2>Website's that I like</h2>
<p> I am interested in making a web portfolio for my final project. There are a few examples that I came across when looking for inspiration.</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href=http://katsy-garcia.com/>Katsy Garcia</a></li>
    <li class="blockquote">Katsy is an illustrator, designer, and dance party instigator currently based in Manila, Philippines. Most of her work focuses on branding/identity, print &amp; web design, and illustration."</li>
  <li> <a href=http://sociodesign.co.uk/>Socio Design</a></li>
    <li class="blockquote">"We like to get out and about to see our clients -- more than happy to sit down and discuss a project over coffee or a bite to eat. If you would like to meet up, talk through a project or find out more, feel free to get in touch."</li>
  <li>Thing 3 </li>
  <li>Thing 4 </li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for visiting my website!</p>
