<h1>BRIANNA'S DESIGN DOCUMENT</h1>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This website will act as my personal portfolio. There are two main purposes for this website. First, I want this to be an easy way for potenial employers to view my latest work. To ensure this,  I will need to update my website regularly. Second, I want my website to be able to give employers an easy way to contact me.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Audience:</h2>
<p>The target audience for this website will be newspaper designers and editors. This group of people probably goes through a ton of portfolios a day, so I need to give them an easy and fast way to view my work.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2>Needs Assessment:</h2>
<p>Four potential employeers gave me insight on what they would want to see on a designer's website. Employeers want to see a nice, clean website that doesn't distract from a designer's work. They also belive that quality is a lot more important than quanity when they are looking at your deisgn clips.</p>

<h3>Questions asked to the group:</h3>
<ul>
<li class="blockquote">What type of information would you find helpful on a potential applicant's website?</li>
<li>An easy way to contact an applicant</li>
<li>Their best work</li>
<li>An updated resume</li>
<li>A little bit about the designer, so we know if they would fit in with the company</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li class="blockquote">What is most important to you when you are viewing someone's portfolio?</li>

</ul>
<br>
